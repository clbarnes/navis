        NAVis is a Python library for analysis and visualization of neuron
        morphology. It stands on the shoulders of the excellent
        `natverse <http://natverse.org>`_ for R.

        For a brief introduction to the library, please see
        :ref:`Quickstart <quickstart>`. Visit the :ref:`installation page<installing>`
        to learn how to install the package. You can browse the
        :ref:`example gallery<example_gallery>` and :ref:`API reference <api>` to see
        what you can do with navis.

        NAVis is designed to be highly extensible. Make sure to check out the other
        libraries in the navis :ref:`ecosystem <other_libs>`.

        NAVis is licensed under the GNU GPL v3+ license. The source code is hosted
        at `Github <https://github.com/navis-org/navis>`_. Feedback, feature requests,
        bug reports and general questions are very welcome and best placed in a
        `Github issue <https://github.com/navis-org/navis/issues>`_.
